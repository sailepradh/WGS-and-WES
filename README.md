# WGS-and-WES
Whole genome and whole exome sequencing comparative study in myelosuppressive toxicity patients

The major goal of project is to identify strengths and weakness of each platform in the context of large scale genome projects. 
*  We will identify common variants from both platforms and study parameters in relationship to each other
*  Furthermore, we will propose a threshold coverage which will be equilavent to each other
